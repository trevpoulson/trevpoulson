			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<h4>Problem</h4>
			<p>Healthicity was rebuilding it's 7Atlis web application and wanted to create a better experience for it's users when they loged into the application. Below is an initial screenshot of the application.</p>
			<img src="/images/dashboard/home-v0.jpg" class="starting-out">
			<p>When I started this project, the team was already behind schedule and had to have a working application for a commited launch date four weeks out. This didn't leave us much time for development and design.</p>
			<p>In addition, we needed to create a responsive design that worked on any screen size, but was optimized for larger screens.</p>

			
			<h4>Users, Stakeholders and Development Team</h4>
			<p>There were three main user types, a Super Admin, Compliance Officer and Limited User. Each of these user types have diffrent roles in the application and orginization.</p>
			<p>Primary stakeholders consisted of a Product Owner, V.P. of Marketing, and the President of Healthicity.</p>
			<p>My team consisted of Product Manger, a Remote Engineering team of three, and me as the Product Designer. In addition, there were three on-site users that I could use for testing and feedback.</p>
			<h4>KPI's and Success</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Completed on time</li>
				<li>Responsive Design</li>
				<li>Increased Customer Satisfaction</li>
				<li>Updated Branding</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<h4>User-Testing</h4>
			<p>On an intial customer satisfaction survey, we found that only <strong>28%</strong> of users said that the dashboard provided additional value and only <strong>36%</strong> said they were happy with their experience with the dashboard.</p>
			<p>When I began user-testing, the first thing I realized was that users were't sure where to go in the application, or what they needed to focus on.</p>
			<h4>Stakeholder Interviews</h4>
			<p>The company was in the process of being rebranded and the V.P. of Marketing wanted to have an applictaion with visual appeal. He wanted to ensure the visual design promotited the new Healthicity brand statement of "simplicity" while brining the overall look of the applicaiton into the modern era.</p>
