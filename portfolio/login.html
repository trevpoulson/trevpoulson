               <h4>Problem:</h4>
               <p>Our users were confused and frustrated at having to use more than one login systems to access our products.</p>
               <h4>Solution:</h4>
               <p>Create a unified login system with shared credentials for all products that could easily be implemented and scaled across multiple product teams.</p>
               <h4>Overview:</h4>
			<p>Healthcity started out with two distinct products created by different teams. Within the first year, we added three new products with another two on the horizon. Through user research and analytics, we discovered that many of our users were using more than one of our products, but were having a hard time because none of them were unified.</p>
			<p>After discussing the problem with my product team we decided that unifying the products might be a good idea to both, improve usability, and bring more cross-sell opportunities for the business. After meeting with stakeholders and execs we decided that we should start with a login app because it was the simplest piece to build and test.</p>
			<p>After 10 rounds of usability and concept testing, we were able to create a unified login app that worked for all of our products, tested extremely well, and helped simplify the pains our users were having with the login process.</p>
