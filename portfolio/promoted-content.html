               <h4>Problem:</h4>
               <p>The Promoted Content piece on the homepage was not meeting expectation for conversion rate after the site redesign.</p>
			<br>
               <h4>Solution:</h4>
               <p>Update the promoted slide to better show of key art, include animation, and provide a clear call to action.</p>
			<br>
               <h4>Overview:</h4>
			<p>After the launch of the improved blizzard shop, I noticed the Promoted Content on the home page was not meeting our expectations for conversion rate. We saw through analytics that users were seeing the Promoted Content but they weren’t clicking on it. I worked with our research team to understand why and found that users thought the Content looked too much like an ad and it’s  “wall of text” which made them ignore it.</p>
			<p>Based on this research, i had a hypothesis that by both showing the content in a more visually stunning way and reducing the complexity of the content, the users would be less apt to ignore it. I started out by AB testing updated visuals with less text and although this worked, i still felt there was room for improvement. To help draw the users in more, I created and tested intro animations and a parallaxing background image, The test showed an increase in conversion rate above our expectations. Since launch, the updated Promoted Content section of the home page has continually performed well and has helped increase the overall conversion rate of shop.</p>

               <p class="overview">There were minor diference between the original design and the version launched with shop. Users were ignoring the design because they thought it looked to much like an add. After the redesign, users thought content was compelling and interesting, resulting in higher conversion rates.</p>
