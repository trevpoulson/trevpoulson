				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<h4>Problem</h4>
				<p>Healthicity was rebuilding its 7Atlis web application and wanted to create a better experience for its users. Initially we decided to focus on the experience of when they logged into the application. Below is an initial screen-shot of the application.</p>
				<img src="/images/dashboard/home-v0.jpg" class="starting-out">
				<p>When I started this project, the team was already behind schedule and had to have a working application for a committed launch date four weeks out. This didn't leave us much time for development and design.</p>
				<p>In addition, we needed to create a responsive design that worked on any screen size, but was optimized for larger screens.</p>

				
				<h4>Users, Stakeholders and Development Team</h4>
				<p>There were three main user types, a Super Admin, Compliance Officer and Limited User. Each of these user types have different roles in the application and within the organization.</p>
				<p>Primary stakeholders consisted of a Product Owner, V.P. of Marketing, and the President of Healthicity.</p>
				<p>The product team consisted of Product Manger, a Remote Engineering team of three, and myself as the Product Designer. In addition, there were three on-site users that I could use for testing and feedback.</p>
				<h4>KPI's and Success</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The project must be completed on time</li>
					<li>Designs must be be responsive</li>
					<li>Final dashboard must increase overall customer satisfaction</li>
					<li>The product must include updated company branding</li>
				</ul>

			<section id="research" class="research">
				<h2>Research</h2>
				<h4>User-Testing and Benchmarking</h4>
				<p>On an initial customer satisfaction survey, we found that only <strong>28%</strong> of users said that the dashboard provided additional value and only <strong>36%</strong> said they were happy with their experience with the dashboard.</p>
				<h4>Stakeholder Interviews</h4>
				<p>The company was in the process of being re-branded and the V.P. of Marketing wanted to have an application with visual appeal. He wanted to ensure the design promoted the new Healthicity brand statement of "simplicity" while bringing the overall look of the application into the modern era.</p>
				<h4>Findings</h4>
				<p>When following up with the user testing survey, the first thing I realized was that users weren't sure where to go in the application, or what they needed to focus on. Other concerns were lack of historical data and not enough room on the screen to work.</p>
				<p>I compiled a list of tasks the users were most likely to do on each of the dashboard pages and the most relevant information on that page and began there.</p>

				<h2>Prototyping</h2>
				<br>
				<p>The first thing I did when I started this project was to have Google Analytics installed into the application so I could track results and see where people needed to go.</p>

				<div class="version">
					<h4>Sketching</h4>
					<p>After we began tracking results, I started sketching out ideas for the application. I tried to incorporate all of the lessons I learned from the user testing.</p>
					<img src="/images/dashboard/sketch-1.jpg" >
					<img src="/images/dashboard/sketch-2.jpg" >
				</div>
				<div class="version">
					<h4>Wire-Framing</h4>
					<p>After reviewing the sketches with the product team, we decided to move forward with one of the designs. I put together a wire-frame that we began to review with a select number of users and key stakeholders.</p>
					<img src="/images/dashboard/home-v2.png" >
				</div>
				<div class="version">
					<h4>Mock-ups</h4>
					<p>After multiple rounds of revisions with both the stakeholders and product team, we realized that developing graphs and charts in the application weren't going to be ready in time for launch, so we left them for another iteration of the dashboards. We selected a card based system for showing users what was important and color coding them to let the users know if there were any problems. We also gave them a clear call to action to help them learn what to do with the cards.</p>

					<img src="/images/dashboard/home-v7.png" >
				</div>
				<div class="version one-up">
					<h4>Interaction</h4>
					<p>Once a final visual design was decided on, I tested the design via a functioning html prototype with in-person user interviews. I tested final button and card states as well as what cards to show, the status colors on them and the call-to-action text for specific cards. </p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<img src="/images/dashboard/final.png" class="final">
				<p>The results were pretty spectacular and our users met the change with great enthusiasm. Within 30 days of launch we ran another customer satisfaction survey and found an increase of 45% with the dashboard pages. The users sited their main reason for the increase in satisfaction as being the the quick access to the areas of the application they needed. In addition, the project was completed on-time and met all branding standards for the company.</p>
				<p>If I would have had more communication between design and engineering throughout the process, we would have realized sooner that the time involved in creating a custom graph was beyond the scope of the project and I could have spent more time working on other aspects of the design. Because of this, I now review all prototypes, starting with sketches, to the engineers before moving forward to gain feasibility.  </p>
