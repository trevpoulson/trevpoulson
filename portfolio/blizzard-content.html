				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<h4>Problem</h4>
				<p>Healthicity was creating new products and it was causing problems for our users. Based on user-interviews and research, we found that it was confusing and time consuming for users to log into each product with different credentials. Furthermore, the users didn't have a way to report on cross product analytics or send messages between products.</p>

				<blockquote>A unified platform would create a better overall experience for our users by solving most of their problems and creating a simpler, unified experience...</blockquote>

				<h4>Big Idea</h4>
				<p>I had an idea to unify our products into a single platform. My hypothesis was that a unified platform would create a better overall user experience by solving most of their problems with logging-in, reporting and messaging. It would also enable us to create a more simple and unified experience, helping users focus on their work instead of administering their accounts.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<h4>Buy In from the Big Guys.</h4>
				<p>I needed to get buy in from the business on my platform idea before we could start moving forward. Because this project was new and we didn't have a budget for a product team yet, I took it upon myself to work with the Sales, Marketing, and Engineering departments to understand their needs and thoughts on the project. I created a presentation to elicit empathy for our users and help the business understand their problems. After having a lot of conversations, all the departments were on board with creating a unified platform for our products and establishing it as as vision for our company.</p>

				</div>
				<h4>Where to Begin, an MVP Approach</h4>
				<p>With such a huge undertaking, we needed to start somewhere. I mapped out some ideas on what the Unified Platform could look like and how it could function. I met with each of the departments for input and ultimately decided that the login aspect of the project was going to have the biggest impact for our users and be the simplest piece to build and test.</p>

				<h2>Designing a Better Login </h2>
				<p>After the approach was decided, I spend time with the individual product designers, and their users, to really understand the problems with each product's login work-flows. My approach was to focus on user needs first and demonstrate to the business that what's best for the users is best for the business. Together, the design team interviewed over 20 users and used analytics to gain insight as to where problems existed, so we could focus on fixing them with the new design.</p>

				<h4>Initial Design</h4>

				</div>

				<h4>Problems and Solution</h4>
				<p>We found that we were confusing our users with different login screens, work-flows and processes for each product. For instance, each of our products had a different "reset password" work-flow and different password complexities. My first step in solving these problems was to simplify the overall experience and to accomplish this, I mapped out the current work-flows for each of the products, then created new user flows that addressed all the needs of each of the product.</p>

					<img src="/images/login/flow-3.png">
					<img src="/images/login/flow-4.png">
					<img src="/images/login/flow-5.png">
				</div>
				<p>After mapping out the user-flows, we knew what screens needed to be created, so we mapped out what features needed to be on each screen. Whenever we added a new feature, we did an exercise about simplification. We asked, "Is this best for the user?" if not, we stripped it out of the features list. One such example was when Marketing wanted to put a advertising section on the initial login screen. They wanted to show users advertising messages and present them with various offers. I disagreed with the Director of Marketing on this and argued that the purpose of the login screen was to help users log into the product and not have them leave the site to look at our "latest offer." I didn't think it was in the users best interest and stripped the requirement on building the section. Although marketing wasn't happy about this, ultimately they realized that it wasn't in the users best interest and supported my decision.</p>
				<div class="images ">

					<img src="/images/login/process-2.jpg">
				</div>
				<p>With the feature list complete, I moved onto wire-frames. We'd already been discussing visual design so we had some idea what the screen layout would look like, so I started adding features to pages and developing wire-frames. With each iteration, I tested the ideas and visuals with users to get feedback and tried to establish the level of complexity.</p>
				<img src="/images/login/process-1.jpg">

				<h4>Visual Design</h4>
				<p>A little bit fore this project started, I had one of the other designers create a couple sketches of how a new login screen could look for his product. When we started out with this project, I used his initial sketches to get feedback from the branding department and used it as a basis for moving forward.</p>
				<img src="/images/login/sketches.jpg">
				<p>I picked a couple of the concepts in the sketch and created high fidelity mock-ups. I then tested the designs with users looking for feedback on usability and brand awareness. </p>
				<div class="images small">
					<img src="/images/login/concept-1.jpg" >
					<img src="/images/login/concept-2.jpg" >
				</div>
				<p>After deciding on a visual approach, I designed each screen and feature with an extremely user-centric approach. We had some ideas that we wanted to try out that we thought could help the users, such as replacing the password confirmation box and showing a help section for password complexity. Other ideas were a little more straight forward, but everything I designed, I put our users first. Focusing on what was best for them.</p>
				<h4>Multiple Products</h4>
				<p>In addition to the login app working at a platform level, we needed the ability to have product specific login screen for users that would not be part of the platform. The design was created in such a way that it could be branded for each of our products, but maintain a consistent experience.</p>

					<img src="/images/login/login-hy.jpg" >
					<img src="/images/login/login-tc.jpg" >
				</div>


				<h4>Final Design</h4>
				<p>The final design was sent to the engineering team to create a final product for testing within each of our products. We validated and tested with a variety of users at every step of the process, making sure to simplify everything we could, only cutting from our MVP what was not best for the users. We gained a lot of feedback and made a lot of revisions, but in the end, everything came together.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Throughout the process, I worked with other product teams to ensure everything was helping their users. I made sure every other department was on board with all of our designs and informed throughout the process. In the end, we were able to create a more simplified login process that was praised by our users for its ease-of-use both quickly and efficiently with minimal budget.</p>

				<p>The design is currently being build by our engineering team where it will be implemented in a way that can be further tested with our users before being pushed live.</p>
