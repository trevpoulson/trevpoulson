			<h4>Problem:</h4>
			<p>Experticity had two separate brands (3point5 and Promotive) that each had their own branding, customer base and ecommerce solutions. They needed to create a unified shopping experience under the Experticity brand.</p>
			<h4>KPI's and Success</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The unified site needed to be responsive.</li>
				<li>New branding must be applied to the new site and maintain consistency with the rest of the site.</li>
				<li>Maintain feature parity between the old sites and the new experience.</li>
				<li>Merge the two code-bases into a single code-base</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p>Over the course of 9 months, I worked with a team of engineers, pms and visual designers to unify two ecommerce sites, into a single, more usable store.</p>

			<p class="overview">When I started working on this project, Experticity was split into two different ecommcerce sites, 3point5 and Promotive. Each had it's own features and way of ways of doing things.</p>

				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>I worked closely with the PM and Designer to distill the purpose of each page in the old designs and determine exactly what we were trying to accomplish with each. After determining the user-flow of the current experiences, we began speaking with users to validate our findings as well as finding any usability issues with the current designs.</p>
				<p>In tandem with the user-testing, I spent time researching the best way to build our designs in a way that could work with our entire customer bases' catalog of products while delivering top performance to the users.</p>
				<h4>Design</h4>
				<p>The designer and I worked though numerous designs and iterations until we found a solution that met all of the specifications, performed well on initial user-tests, and worked responsively with all devices and screen sizes. </p>
				<h4>Pattern Library</h4>
				<p>Between the iterative design sessions, I worked with the design team to build a pattern library that could be used by all the designers and UI Engineers in the organization to create a consistent design, platform-wide. This pattern library was custom build using LESS and Javascript and was distributed via NPM. It included a custom responsive / adaptive grid and variable-based mix-ins for custom and standard UI components that supported a semantic based design approach. </p>

				<h4>Front End Development</h4>
				<p>Once the initial designs and work-flows for the new experience were complete, I build the front-end using Angular.js and RESTful services. Because we were using the pattern library and the designer and I had worked so closely throughout the design process, I only needed rough designs for most of the screens.  Whenever there was a design questions or I needed clarification, the designer and I would come up with an approach that was both feasible and usable.</p>
				<h4>Back End Development</h4>
				<p>While working with the development team, we made it a point to always communicate everything that was going on throughout the process. When creating services, we would discuss the requirements upfront and address any issues we may run into. When any issues did arise, we worked as a team to create a solution that focused first and foremost on the user-experience.</p>
				<h4>Focus</h4>
				<p>The focus of all of this work was on the user and their experience with the Experticity store. Throughout the entire process, we did not compromise on following that one guiding principal and, in the end, our users felt it.</p>

				<p class="overview">When the Experticity store was finished, the user-testing showed a huge jump in customer satisfaction and the analytics showed an increase in conversion rate. Our team exceeded all of our expectations and the system we developed for working together was a model for the rest of the company.</p>
