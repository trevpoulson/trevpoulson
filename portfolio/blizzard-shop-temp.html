               <h4>Problem:</h4>
               <p>The original battle.net shop was optimized for few franchises and was built on decade old technology that took significant effort to update. Our stakeholders wanted to make the shop more personalized and create a system that would allow us to double the number of franchises over the coming years. In addition, we discovered numerous usability issues though a mixture of user interviews data analysis that we wanted to address.</p>
               <h4>Solution:</h4>
               <p>Redesign the Blizzard Shop in a responsive way that would allow for scalability and personalization while addressing usability issues uncovered during research. All of this should be done in a way that showcases Blizzard's franchises and brand.</p>
               <h4>Overview:</h4>
               <p>Through multiple rounds of concept and usability testing, we were able to find a design that met all of our stakeholder needs while addressing usability issues found in the original shop. In the end we were able to deliver a responsive design that was personalized for users, offered better categorization, and showed off the level of polish our users expected. </p>
               <p>Since the launch in late 2017, we continue to monitor our performance though established KPIs and continuous user research iterating where needed.</p>
