			<h4>Problem:</h4>
			<p>Update the Blizzard Digital Shop to account for our growing product catalog, handle localization and regionality for our global offerings, and work with all device types and sizes.</p>
			<h4>Solution:</h4>
			<p>Redesign the Blizzard Shop following mobile-first responsive design patterns in a way that allows for scalability and personalization (by locale, region, and individual). Additionally, we wanted to address usability issues uncovered during user-research and provide additional features to help our users find the products that are right for them. All of this needed to be done in a way that showcased Blizzard's franchises and overall brand.</p>
			<h4>Overview:</h4>
			<p>Initially, I was approached about redesigning the shop to make it more scalable for future releases and make the designs more responsive. Through user-research and testing, we were able to find and address usability issues as well as problems our users were having finding the right products.</p>
			<p> In the end we were able to address the business needs of scalability, responsiveness, & personalization and users needs with better categorization and discoverability, while demonstrating the level of polish our users expect.</p>
			<p>Since the launch in late 2017, we continue to monitor our performance though established KPIs and continuous user research iterating where needed.</p>

               <h2 class="section-title">Final Designs</h2>
                    <p class="overview">The designs below were the final mocks before moving to the build phase of the project. For the final step of design, I built a prototype in HTML / CSS /JS for handoff to developers. This prototype allowed me to precisely adjust the responsive layouts and animations on the pages.
