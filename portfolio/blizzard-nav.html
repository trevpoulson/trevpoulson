               <h4>Problem:</h4>
               <p>During post-launch usability sessions with the Blizzard shop redesign, I noticed users were having problems with the new navigation during certain scenarios as well as problems with the overall discoverability of the new navigation. Through analytics, we noticed a drop off in conversions from users using the global navigation.</p>
               <h4>Solution:</h4>
               <ol>
				<li>Make it easier to reach the Shop from Game Sites</li>
				<li>Make the Shop Navigation easier to find</li>
				<li>Simplify cross-franchise and cross-product navigation</li>
               </ol>
               <h4>Overview:</h4>
               <p>When we began usability testing on the Blizzard shop, I focused on what I thought was the most likely scenarios. However, after launch, we discovered through analytics and user research that there were a few cases that we had missed and were causing issues.  We took a holistic approach to the navigation and went back to the drawing board to find out how users were using the shop and the journey they were taking to get there. </p>
			<p>I found that most of our users were navigation to the shop from one of our game-sites and there wasn’t a consistently easy path to the shop from them. We also found that many of our users were actually browsing through multiple products and franchises within the same session  and we hadn’t provided a clear cut way to do this. Lastly, a large portion of our users were not able to find the shop navigation easily. </p>
